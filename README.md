I am an enthusiastic and curious learner with a foundational understanding of Artificial Intelligence concepts, particularly in Machine Learning. I also possess hands-on experience in web development using HTML, CSS,  JavaScript and react.js along with beginner-level programming skills in Python. I enjoy solving real-world problems with technology and am actively working to deepen my expertise across both AI and full-stack development domains.
